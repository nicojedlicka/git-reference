# Basic GIT workflow

## Setting up a repository

There are two options: create a new repository locally, or clone an
existing remote repository.

### Create a new local repository

```
git init .
```
This will initialise a new repository in the current working directory.

### Clone an existing repository

```
git clone https://github.com/nicojedlicka/git-reference.git 
```
This will create a new working directory *git-reference* and clone the
existing remote repository into it.
